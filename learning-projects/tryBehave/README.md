# Learning Project: The BDD Tet Runner `behave`

I've had some experience with `pytest-bdd` in projects, but I've never been
totally satisfied with it.  In some Ensemble Programming retreats quite a long
time ago, I had the chance to work with the `behave` runner instead, and found it easy to use, with easy-to-read errors and simple syntaxes.  Here, I just wanted
to play a bit with Behave and make sure it made sense to me to add another test 
runner to a project.  

## What I learned

  - `behave` is really pleasant to use!
  - Thinking about BDD tests as seperate from Pytests is beneficial; it puts us in different modes of thought.  
  - Having a clear "features" directory with "steps" subdirectory is quite intuitive, and works well.
  

I'd like to learn more about how to create fixtures, but from what I see, it's pretty straightforward.



## Takeaways

I like `behave` now, even more than ever!
