## Retrospective

### 1. Room setup

Highs:
    - enough desks and chairs needed
    - directing people to gummy bears worked well to make them sit at those spots
    - good desks and chairs
    - spacious room
    - separate drinks space didn't interrupt the flow of the workshop
    - there was enough space for us to walk around and even chat off to the side

Lows:
    - too much distance between the front and the back of the room
    - too much distance from the back to the projector (we needed to point so that people can focus)
    - no mikes (note: might have introduced new challenges)
    - long time for room setup
    - not enough power outlets, many participants had to change their laptops after the first round.
    - people in the back could not see what was going on, asked redundant questions because of that.
    - four people are still more number of people for a team (3 members are enough)

Things we would keep:
    - Maximum

Things we would change:
    - More power outlets

### 2. Introduction

Highs:
    - we covered info we wanted to
    - not too long -- did entire introduction in 15 minutes!
    - it was a success with very little rehearsal
    - used the website as the presentation
    - used the passing structure to go through the introduction
    - mantra also helped with learning the passing structure

Lows:
    - not smooth, sitting and standing felt engineered
    - some of the important information left during the introduction--the booking link disappeared, and the workshop date disappeareed
    - being the free person and moving around felt weird
    - we didn't use our video

## Round 1

Highs:
    - Teams made twice as many commits as expected!
    - The structure did make people work collaboratively (especiall Team 3!)
    - scoreboard worked well, good feedback for us, motivated participants
    - every team made a commit, and every member made a commit
    - top two teams both ended up with a dashboard
    - managed to solve all problems for all the teams
    - most teams adopt passing structure successfully
    - joint ownership helped us to take up any tasks regardless of whether it was assigned to us or not

Lows:
    - Gitpod failed unexpectedly: users couldn't sync (permissions for gitpod to push to github, people forgot their github username, didn't know github sends an email invitation that needs to be explicitly accepted.)
    - people were stressed during the first round, esp. the first 20 minutes
    - scoreboard wasn't always visible on the screen, while Nick was fixing things
    - was chaotic in the beginning because all of the problems happened for everyone at the beginning
    - we did not do an exercise around figuring out the unknowns and potential obstacles that might happen
    - at least two teams had members that were not engaging by the end of the round 1
    - we forgot the tasks we were assigned
    - less practice, and lack of rehearsal with people not part of the conference
    - mixing things up right before the event
    - needs improvement in co-ordinating troubleshooting and who is doing the troubleshooting where
    - no distribution of tasks towards the end which hurt our team's goal of equal distribution of tasks
    - typo in team 9's link (we had made a fork and the name of the new repo was changed, which was forgotten)

## Round 2

Highs:
    - People really enjoyed the mental rotation task
    - Start very smoothly
    - every one used seaborn during the session
    - we successfully taught the interface
    - people were not working alone
    - people started getting the idea of small commits and using git in general
    - undo button was neat
    - went really well: people enjoyed it!
    - people really got it: no more questions about passing,
    - people learned well from round 1 (especially team 1, who won!  )
    - great comment: "I learned coding!"

Lows:
    - the starting code did not function as expected
    - we did not prepare for round 2 as we planned to (i.e. during the break)
    - in at least one team a member left the workshop because they were left out and their ideas were ignored
    - at least two teams pushed to main, then they copied the code to the other branch and committed all the changes at once!
    - heard from some people that this was not the right way to learn things, did not get sufficient instruction beforehand.
    - Many comments that they felt (uncomfortably) stressed during the session.

## Microretropective

Comments:
    - (negative comment), but I Learned a lot
    - "were suspicious in the beginning, but it worked out"
    - "learned coding, and was participating a lot!"
    - people were still trying to fix the code even during the break!
    - did hear negative comments on gitpod (participant like Spyder more)
    - getting feedback on syntax, errors was really hard for participants

Our thoughts:
    - did demonstrate teamwork, but calling it a game might have reduced the impact of the teaching
    - doing teaching of pandas in streamlit was extremely difficult
    - some groups didn't really utilize the cheatsheet
    - people clicked the "run" button and weren't happy, didn't understand they needed to type the terminal command.
    - did not hear any negative comments about git or github!

Ideas:
    - we could switch up the teams between rounds
    - a proper setup and tutorial section in the beginning would have helped soooo much!

## Next Time, We Should

    - max out at 3x3 tables (participants should be able to see and hear everything)
    - provide power outlets for every table (either confirm or bring it)
    - round 0 teaching session
    - switch up teams between rounds
    - try for 3 members for team, or find role for 4th team member
    - prepare round materials before the workshop
    - automated tests for our teaching materials
    - protect the main branch!
    - don't combine streamlit and pandas
